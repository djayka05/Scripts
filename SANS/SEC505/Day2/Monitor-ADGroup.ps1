A scheduled script can easily monitor the membership of one or more
groups in Active Directory to detect changes and, optionally, to reverse
out these changes.  This is a sample script to get started and could be
fleshed out to include logging, alerting, reversing out changes, etc.

####################################################################### #>

# Which AD group do you wish to monitor?

$MonitoredGroup = "Domain Admins"  


# For the group being monitored, create an array of the desired members
# using either the full paths (safer) or just the common names (easier):

$AuthorizedMembers = 
@(
"CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=testing,DC=local",
"CN=Hal Pomeranz,OU=Boston,OU=East_Coast,DC=testing,DC=local"
) 


# Query the current membership of the monitored group:

Import-Module -Name ActiveDirectory

$Members = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $MonitoredGroup |
           Select-Object -ExpandProperty distinguishedName


# Compare the current members against the list of desired members:

$Differences = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $AuthorizedMembers -DifferenceObject $Members 


# If the lists do not match, the $Differences variable will not be empty:

if ($Differences)
{
    # Add back any missing authorized members:
    ForEach ($mbr in $AuthorizedMembers)
    {
        if ($Members -notcontains $mbr)
        { Add-ADGroupMember -Identity $MonitoredGroup -Members $mbr }
    }

    # Remove any unauthorized members:
    ForEach ($mbr in $Members)
    {
        if ($AuthorizedMembers -notcontains $mbr)
        { Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity $MonitoredGroup -Members $mbr -Confirm:$False } 
    }
}


# In real life, write to a log and issue alerts for each run of the script,
# especially when changes are made.  This is just a starter script.  Also, 
# a script like this should be digitally signed and protected from modification.
